# **🚀 Pomodoro CLI**
A Micro-Task–Driven Productivity Timer for Focused Execution

## Overview
Pomodoro CLI is a modular, command-line productivity tool designed to execute work in micro-task blocks using timed focus sessions.
Inspired by high-performance work principles (including time-boxing and micro-execution strategies), this tool helps users break work into small, executable units and complete them sequentially with discipline.

Unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, Pomodoro emphasizes:

- Task execution over time tracking
- Micro-task scheduling
- Sequential focus
- Minimal distractions
- CLI-first workflow

## ✨ Features
- ⏱️ Micro-Task Timer
    - Assign a fixed time per task
    - Tasks execute one after another automatically
- 🔄 Sequential Task Execution
    - Tasks are processed in order
    - Optional delay between tasks
- 🌀 Live Spinner Timer
    - Animated spinner with real-time countdown
    - Single-line terminal updates (no clutter)
- 🔔 Audio Alerts
    - Start & end alerts for each task
    - Cross-platform fallback support
- 📊 Time Tracking
    - Calculates total focus time
    - Human-readable output (hours/minutes)
- 🧱 Modular Architecture
    - Clear separation of responsibilities
    - Easy to extend or modify

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- Execution beats planning
- Small tasks reduce resistance
- Timers enforce discipline
- CLI keeps focus sharp
- Learning by building > learning by reading

## My Learning
I create projects that makes one programming concept fit in a Big Picture. Like that, In this project I learned the following:
1. Modular Programming
2. Threading in Python
3. Terminal Control (CLI)
4. About Timers in Python

**This project may not be large in scope, but it focuses on understanding how individual libraries and concepts fit into a larger system.**

## 📚 Learning Notes (Planned)
This repository will include a future folder documenting:
- Workflow design decisions
- Algorithms used
- Concepts learned during development
- Personal notes on threading, scheduling, and CLI UX
- Mistakes, fixes, and insights
- Learning is documented in my own words, not copied explanations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Interface: Command Line (CLI)
- Core Concepts:
    - Threading
    - Timers
    - State management
    - Modular design

## 🤝 Contribution
This is currently a personal productivity project, but suggestions and improvements are welcome.

If you find an idea, optimization, or improvement — feel free to open an issue or fork.

## ❤️ Final Note
This project is a reflection of learning by building.
It is not about perfection — it is about progress, execution, and discipline.
